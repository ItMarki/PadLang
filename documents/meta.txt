句:
程式由一串串字組成的。
每一個字是由Unicode的0000到FFFF的字。
如果一個字沒有定義，那麼就沒有效果。
從左至右開始程式。
到達程式的一段就會終止。
沒有使用或者被遺棄的值會被隱含地輸出。
The general syntax for operators are prefix form.
If an uninitialized variable is called, it will be type int of value 0.

Variables:
There are infinite variables of type boolean, int, uint, superint, superuint, float, double, quadruple, str, array, function, object, and variable. These are called normal variables.
There are one of each variable type pointer, direction, program, and stack. These are called special variables.
boolean - Holds value boolean - Holds value of either true or false.
int - A signed 32 bit integer.
uint - An unsigned 32 bit integer.
superint - A signed integer of arbitrary size. More memory is given as the value increases.
superuint - An unsigned integer of arbitrary size. More memory is given as the value increases.
float - A floating-point number according to IEEE 754.
double - A double-precision floatong-point number according to IEEE 754 binary64.
quadruple - A quadruple-precision floating-point number according to IEEE 754 binary128.
str - A string of Unicode characters.
array - An array of normal variables.
function - Takes inputs and evaluates to an output.
object - A collection of normal variables each assigned to a label(which is also a normal variable).
variable - A label which the value can be any normal variable.
pointer - An superint which holds information of which character the program is reading and executing. Initialized to 0.
direction - An superint which holds information of which direction the program is reading. Positive for right, negative for left, 0 for static. The absolute value will dictate at which interval of the program will be read.
program - A str which holds the program itself. Initialized to the equivalent of the source code. Changing this will change the program.
stack - An array which holds superint that shows where the program jumped to execute a function or has looped.
